# Chattix - Yet Another Cross-Platform Chat App

Chattix is a cross-platform chat app that allows users to communicate with their friends and family, share images and locations, and even connect with new people. As the sole developer on the project, I was responsible for building the app from the ground up using React Native, Expo, and Google Firebase.

One of the main challenges I faced was integrating the various Firebase services, including authentication, cloud storage, and cloud firestore. It was a steep learning curve, but I was able to overcome it through trial and error and a lot of documentation reading.

Another challenge was ensuring that the app was compatible with both Android and iOS devices. This required a lot of testing on various emulators and devices, as well as debugging and fixing any issues that arose.

One of the features that I am particularly proud of is the offline functionality. I wanted to make sure that users could still access their messages and send new ones, even if they didn't have an internet connection. To achieve this, I implemented local storage and syncing with the server once an internet connection was established. It was a great learning experience and I am happy with how the feature turned out.

Overall, working on the Chattix project was a fantastic learning opportunity for me. It allowed me to improve my skills in mobile development and cloud computing, and also allowed me to use my problem-solving and creative thinking skills. I am confident that this project will be a valuable addition to my portfolio and help me continue to grow as a developer.
